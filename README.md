##Pong DDQN Agent with Pytorch

This agent uses pytorch to create a ddqn (Double Deep Q Network) to
learn the game of pong. It reads the screen pixels in as the state
and uses the openai gym environment PongNoFrameskip-v4. A number of 
preprocessing steps take place on the original image frames that
uses Phil Tabor's method with a few tweaks. I have been learning AI 
methods through his channel and github - https://github.com/philtabor
